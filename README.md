#Fun with Animate.css

Looking for something new to play with, I started messing around with [Animate.css](http://daneden.github.io/animate.css/), a prepackaged CSS animation library. Using JavaScript to apply classes to objects allows you to trigger a host of prepackaged effects.

As easy and effective as it is, I will definitley be looking to use Animate.css in the near future. For now, you'll have to just enjoy this awesome demo...

Check out the demo for yourself!
